### About me

I'm an Economist and [Monetary Advisor](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/people/michael-waugh) at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/economic-research/economists) and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. My research interests lie within the intersection of international trade, macroeconomics, and development.

### About my repositories

I use GitHub to post code I'm working on (and learning about) and replication materials from selected papers. I also use GitHub and [Heroku](www.heroku.com) to operate the website [www.tradewartracker.com](www.tradewartracker.com) providing live, visual display of international trade data. Below are selected repositories.
