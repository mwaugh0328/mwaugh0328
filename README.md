### About me

I'm an Economist and Monetary Advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. My research interests lie within the intersection of international trade, macroeconomics, and development.

### About my work

I use GitHub to post code I'm working on (and learning about) and replication materials from selected papers. I also operate the website [www.tradewartracker.com](www.tradewartracker.com) providing live, visual display of international trade data.

- Repository for code behind the [www.tradewartracker.com](www.tradewartracker.com) website is [here](https://github.com/tradewartracker) @tradewartracker
