### About me

I'm an Economist and [Monetary Advisor](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/people/michael-waugh) at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org). My research interests lie within the intersection of international trade, macroeconomics, and development. And I'm interested in the use of computational tools to answer quantitative questions in these domains.  

### About my repositories

I use GitHub to post code I'm working on (and learning about), replication materials from selected papers, and past teaching. I also use GitHub and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) to operate the website [www.tradewartracker.com](https://www.tradewartracker.com) providing live, visual display of international trade data. Below are selected repositories.

- [Tradewar Tracker Repository](https://github.com/tradewartracker) for code behind [www.tradewartracker.com](https://www.tradewartracker.com) website.

- My [Garvity-Estimation](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/Gravity-Estimation) repository suplements the JIE repo with basic gravity estimation via STATA and then the computation of the [Eaton and Kortum model](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0262.00352) via simmulation. A Julia version is coming soon.
